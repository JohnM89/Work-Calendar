## Description
Work Day Scheduler with an aesthetic twist!

## üöÄ User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule  
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner  
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

- **WHEN I open the planner**  
  THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar  

- **WHEN I scroll down**  
  THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9 am to 5 pm

- **WHEN I view the time blocks for that day**  
  THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

- **WHEN I click into a time block**  
  THEN I can enter an event

- **WHEN I click the save button for that time block**  
  THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

- **WHEN I refresh the page**  
  THEN the saved events persist
